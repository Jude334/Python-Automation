# Python-Automation
Some Python automation scripts I write at work in my spare time.
While learning Python automation, I learned how to work with the Selenium and Pywinauto packages.
The three with 'DL' at the end are for downloading and installing software.
Win7users is a program that gets information from a computer such as CPU, RAM, etc.
